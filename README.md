# ThinQ Responsive Website

This project is inspired by the Codecademy Path Course 'Full-Stack Engineer' and it's meant to be a landing page of a short presentation of the company ThinQ (which  I really don't know if it really exist).

## Upcoming Updates
This project is created to be updated based on futures courses from Codecademy or outside of the platform. Extra pages will be created, like Portofolio, more informations about
Team, a better understand of the vision of ThinQ and, the webiste will be updated with JavaScript in the future.

## Updated to ThinQ 2.0
HTML code was changed to become a responsive website. The code was structured in a different way in comparison with the old HTML code. It's mutch more simplified now and much easier to be readed. In the same time, the CSS code is separated:

1. style.css - is the stylesheet code for Desktop
2. mobile.css - is the stylesheet for mobile devices

I hope you'll enjoy. And YES. More updates are yet to come.

## Status
The project is **Completed** until the future updates.

## Inspiration

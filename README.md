# ThinQ Responsive Website

This project is inspired by the Codecademy Path Course 'Full-Stack Engineer' and it's meant to be a landing page of a short presentation of the company ThinQ (which  I really don't know if it really exist).

Team, a better understand of the vision of ThinQ and, the webiste will be updated with JavaScript in the future.

## Updated to ThinQ 2.0
HTML code was changed to become a responsive website. The code was structured in a different way in comparison with the old HTML code. It's mutch more simplified now and much easier to be readed. In the same time, the CSS code is separated:

1. style.css - is the stylesheet code for Desktop
2. mobile.css - is the stylesheet for mobile devices

I hope you'll enjoy. And YES. More updates are yet to come.

## Status
The project is **Completed** until the future updates.

## Inspiration
